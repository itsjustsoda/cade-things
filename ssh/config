# Append this to your ~/.ssh/config file and you'll be to quickly ssh into a 
# CADE machine by typing: 
#
#   > ssh lab1 ---- or lab2 or cade
#
#
# This is assuming you have a ssh keypair named 'cade' and 'cade.pub' in your 
# .ssh folder.
#
# You can generate a pair using:
#
#   > ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/cade -q -N "passphrase"
#                                                     |
#          Can be "" if you don't want a passphrase --+
#
#
# Afterwards, you'll need to install the keys to the CADE machines.
# This will add your key to the list of authorized keys on CADE allowing you
# to log in without having to type in your password.
#
#   > ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/cade cadelogin@lab1-1.eng.utah.edu

# The CADE machines I've picked are arbitrary. You can choose different 
# machines if you want. The list of all the CADE machines is available at:
